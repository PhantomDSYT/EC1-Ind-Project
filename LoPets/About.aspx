    <p class="lead">A little about me</p>
    <p>
        I am 21 years of age and I aspire to be a software developer but more specifically a game developer, <br />
        I have a history of video editing and making 3D animations and sculpting as it was part of the skillset I <br />
        acquired from making YouTube videos. <br />
        <br />
        I am now learning to create games and working on both frontend and backend engineering
